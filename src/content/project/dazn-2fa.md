## How to Limit sharing and fraud

To limit account sharing and fraud, we wanted DAZN account owners to occasionally answer challenges, ensuring any activity outside the owner’s household or location has their authorisation. Several prevalent 2FA methods are used in consumer apps, offering varying levels of security and convenience. Creating a 2FA system was intended to establish trust on a new device by asking the DAZN account owner to authorise its use while also securing My Account so bad actors cannot change passwords and hijack DAZN accounts.

To ensure 2FA can be reused, ideally a plug-and-play 2FA module with secure front-end and back-end components, could be used universally across DAZN for any insecure scenario, such as accessing My Account, using the betting app, etc.

### Scope

| Aspect | Answer          |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Time   | 2 Months        |
| Team   | Agile           |
| Role   | UX / Design     |
| Tools  | Figma / VS Code |

### Process

As any 2FA introduces friction to users, we created these tenets which must be adhered to whilst selecting and implementing 2FA methods:

-   2FA setup is not the account owner’s problem and should not require them to complete cumbersome setup routines or install 3rd party apps.
-   We will not throw a 2FA challenge to a user who does not have the ability to solve it.
